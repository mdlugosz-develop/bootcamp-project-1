## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

This notebook analyzes contract awards financed by The World Bank under Investment Project Financing (IPF) operations and explores the relationship between these awards and GDP growth across different regions.

### Data Sources
- [World Bank Contract Awards Dataset](https://financesone.worldbank.org/contract-awards-in-investment-project-financing/DS00005)
- [World Bank GDP Growth Indicator](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG)

## Data Preparation <a name="data-preparation"></a>

In this section, we import the necessary libraries and load the datasets for analysis.

[Code cells for importing libraries and reading data]

**Discussion:**
- We've imported key libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
- The GDP dataset provides annual GDP growth rates for countries worldwide from 2015 to 2023.
- Initial data exploration shows the structure of our datasets.

## Project Global Practice Analysis <a name="project-global-practice-analysis"></a>

This section examines the distribution of contract awards across different project global practices.

**Discussion:**
- The pie chart illustrates the distribution of projects across various global practices.
- We can observe that [insert observations about the top practices and their relative percentages].
- This analysis helps us understand which sectors receive the most funding through World Bank contracts.

## Procurement Category Analysis <a name="procurement-category-analysis"></a>

Here, we analyze the distribution of contracts by procurement category.

**Discussion:**
- The pie chart shows the breakdown of contracts by procurement category.
- We can see that [insert observations about the dominant procurement categories and their percentages].
- This information provides insights into the types of goods and services most frequently procured through World Bank contracts.

## Regional GDP Growth Analysis <a name="regional-gdp-growth-analysis"></a>

In this section, we examine the average GDP growth trends across different regions from 2015 to 2023.

[Code cells for Regional GDP Growth analysis and visualization]

**Discussion:**
- The line graph displays average GDP growth rates for various regions over time.
- We can observe [insert observations about regional growth trends, notable peaks or troughs, and any apparent correlations with contract awards].
- This analysis helps us understand the economic context in which World Bank contracts are awarded across different regions.

[Final code cell with conclusion placeholder]

**Conclusion:**
Summarize key findings from the analysis, including:
- The most prominent project global practices in terms of contract distribution
- The dominant procurement categories
- Regional economic growth trends and their potential relationship with contract awards

Discuss potential implications of these findings for World Bank investment strategies and development outcomes in different regions.
